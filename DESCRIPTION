Description: An implementation of the functional residual framework described in
    XYZ. Functional residuals provide a novel diagnostic framework for 
    generalized linear models (GLMs) and beyond, addressing limitations in 
    traditional residuals for discrete outcome data. The framework uses 
    functional residuals, which capture residual randomness that classical point 
    statistics fail to represent, and provides new diagnostic tools like the 
    functional-residual-vs-covariate and function-to-function plots. It broadens 
    the diagnostic scope across various GLMs, including models for binary, 
    ordinal, count data, and semiparametric models, offering a unified approach 
    for both discrete and continuous data.
